                        <p>We had room blocks at two hotels right next door to eachother: <b>Hampton Inn in Beloit, WI</b> and <b>Home2 Suites by Hilton Beloit</b>. The room block is no longer valid as we are less than 30 days out but there are still rooms available at each of those hotels.</p>
                        <p>Other convenient hotels include the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/rfdbl-fairfield-inn-and-suites-beloit/">Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Beloit</a> which is across the street from the Hampton and the <a href="http://ironworkshotel.com/beloit/">Ironworks Hotel</a>. All four are marked on the map below.

                        <h4>Getting Around</h4>
                        <p>Mass is at 2:00pm and Cocktail Hour starts at 6:00pm so hang out in between while the wedding party takes pictures. </p>
                        <p>You are welcome to drive to venue, there is plenty of parking. We will also have shuttles departing from the Hampton Inn & HOME2 at 5:30pm and 5:40pm(they are right next door to eachother). The buses can also make stops at the Fairfield and Ironworks if necessary. If you're staying anywhere other than the Hampton or HOME2 and would like a ride, please contact us so we can tell the driver to stop there. Return trips from the venue to hotels will start around 8:30pm and depart periodically until 11:15pm.</p>
                        <p>Celebrations at the venue end at 11pm, but for any overachievers, there is a late night bar right next door to the Hampton & HOME2 called Jersey's.</p>
